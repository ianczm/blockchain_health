# FAQ
Q1: What if I want to open this project on Mac?

Mac users can try to prepare a VirtualBox Windows 10 virtual machine or equivalant. Windows Activation is not mandatory. With this virtual machine, Mac users can follow the steps above to open the project.

Q2: Why I cannot add doctor?

Due to a reported issue at github (https://github.com/shamil-t/ehr-blockchain/issues/15), a proper IPFS config is required to perform this feature properly. Check the installation section, step 1, to make sure your IPFS config ia set up correctly.

Q3: Why the virtual machine need to access all CPUs?

Node.js will not function properly and can produce error like assertion time error if not all CPUs are used. To reduce the chance of the assertion time error, the virtual machine have to access all CPUs to run properly. Before a yarn command is run, make sure the clock is sync by checking FAQ Q4.

Q4: Assertion failed when yarn install, what should I do?

Go to Windows settings, Time & Language, Date & time. Then sync the time again by click Sync Now button under Synchronise the clock.
